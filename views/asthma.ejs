        <h2 class>Overview</h2>
        <p>Asthma is a condition where the airways in the lungs become inflamed and narrowed, 
            leading
            to difficulty breathing. This inflammation can cause the airways to produce excess mucus, 
            further restricting airflow. Triggers like allergens, exercise, or cold air can worsen the 
            symptoms, causing an asthma attack.<br><br>
            
            During an asthma attack, the muscles around the airways tighten, and the inflammation 
            increases, making it harder for air to move in and out of the lungs. Without proper 
            treatment,
            this can lead to severe breathing problems. While asthma is a chronic condition, it can be 
            managed with medication and by avoiding known triggers.<br><br>
            Asthma is sometimes called a reactive airway disease.</p>

        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <p>Asthma symptoms can vary in intensity. Some people have mild symptoms, while others experience severe attacks. Common asthma symptoms include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shortness of breath</li>
            <li>Wheezing (a whistling sound when breathing)</li>
            <li>Chest tightness or discomfort</li>
            <li>Coughing, especially at night or early in the morning</li>
            <li>Trouble sleeping due to breathing difficulties</li>
        </ul>
        <P>Symptoms can worsen with exposure to triggers like allergens, cold air, or exercise.
            In severe cases, asthma attacks can lead to a significant inability to breathe, requiring immediate medical attention.Some people may have warning signs, such as coughing or mild wheezing, before a full asthma attack occurs.
       </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <p> Asthma is caused by inflammation and narrowing of the airways, which makes it difficult to breathe. The exact cause of asthma isn't fully understood, but several factors can trigger or worsen symptoms. Common causes and triggers include:

           
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Allergens: Dust mites, pollen, mold, pet dander, and cockroach droppings can trigger asthma symptoms.</li>
            <li>Respiratory infections: Colds, flu, and other respiratory infections can cause asthma flare-ups.</li>
            <li>Exercise: Physical activity, especially in cold air, can induce asthma symptoms.</li>
            <li>Air pollutants: Smoke, fumes, strong odors, and pollution can irritate the airways.</li>
            <li>Weather changes: Cold air or sudden weather changes can lead to asthma attacks.</li>
            <li>Stress or strong emotions: Intense emotions, such as stress or laughter, can also trigger asthma.</li>
            <li>Genetics: Asthma often runs in families, making people more likely to develop the condition if their parents or siblings have it.</li>  
        </ul>
        <P>Asthma can be triggered by one or a combination of these factors, and managing triggers is key to controlling symptoms.
