        <h2 class>Overview</h2>
        <p>A heart attack occurs when the flow of blood to the heart is blocked, usually by a buildup of 
            fat, cholesterol, and other substances in the coronary arteries. This blockage stops oxygen 
            from reaching the heart muscle, leading to damage. Triggers such as stress, heavy exertion, 
            or pre-existing conditions like high blood pressure or diabetes can increase the risk of a heart
            attack.
            <br><br>
            During a heart attack, the blocked artery prevents blood from reaching parts of the heart, 
            causing tissue to die. Without proper treatment, this can result in permanent heart damage or
            even death. Quick medical intervention is critical to restoring blood flow and minimizing 
            damage.
            <br><br>
            While heart attacks can be life-threatening, they are often preventable with lifestyle changes, 
            medication, and by managing risk factors like high cholesterol and smoking.
            <br><br>
            A heart attack is also known as a myocardial infarction.</p><br><br>

        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <p>Heart attack symptoms can vary in severity. Some people may experience mild symptoms, while others have more intense or sudden symptoms. Common signs of a heart attack  include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Chest pain or discomfort (pressure, squeezing, or aching)</li>
            <li>Pain spreading to the arms, shoulders, back, neck, or jaw</li>
            <li>Shortness of breath, even at rest</li>
            <li>Cold sweats</li>
            <li>Fatigue or weakness</li>
            <li>Nausea or indigestion</li>
            <li>Dizziness or lightheadedness</li>
        </ul>
        <P>Symptoms can worsen with physical activity or stress. In severe cases, heart attacks can 
        cause sudden and complete blockage of blood flow to the heart, requiring immediate 
        medical attention. Some people may have early warning signs like chest discomfort or 
        shortness of breath before a full heart attack occurs.
        </p>
        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <p> A heart attack is caused by reduced or blocked blood flow to the heart muscle, typically due to a buildup of fat, cholesterol,
             and other substances (plaques) in the coronary arteries. Several factors can lead to or increase the risk of a heart attack. 
             Common causes and risk factors include:
            
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Coronary artery disease: Plaque buildup in the arteries, causing narrowing and reducing blood flow.
            </li>
            <li>High cholesterol: Excess cholesterol can lead to plaque formation in the arteries.
            </li>
            <li>High blood pressure: Puts extra strain on the heart and arteries, contributing to artery damage.
            </li>
            <li>Smoking: Damages the heart and blood vessels, increasing plaque formation.
            </li>
            <li>Diabetes: High blood sugar levels can damage blood vessels and contribute to artery blockage.
            </li>
            <li>Obesity: Excess weight increases the strain on the heart and can lead to high cholesterol and diabetes.
            </li>
            <li>Sedentary lifestyle: Lack of physical activity increases the risk of heart disease.
            </li>
            <li>Stress: Prolonged stress can raise blood pressure and contribute to heart attacks.
            </li>
            <li>Genetics: Family history of heart disease increases the likelihood of having a heart attack.
            </li>
        </ul>
