        <h2 class>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Electric shock occurs when a person comes into contact with an electrical current, which can
            pass through the body and cause damage to tissues, nerves, and organs. The severity of the 
            injury depends on factors like the voltage, duration of exposure, and the path the current 
            takes through the body. Electric shock can lead to burns, muscle contractions, and damage to
            the heart, brain, and other organs.<br><br>

            During electric shock, the muscles may contract involuntarily, making it hard to let go of the
            electrical source. In severe cases, electric shock can cause cardiac arrest or respiratory
            failure. Without immediate treatment, electric shock can result in serious injury or even
            death. While electric shock injuries can vary, itâ€™s important to seek medical attention and 
            avoid further contact with the electrical source.<br><br>
 
            Electric shock can sometimes be called electrical injury or electrocution, depending on its
            severity.  
        </p><br><br>

        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <p>Electric shock symptoms can vary based on the strength and duration of the electrical current and where it enters and exits the body. Common symptoms include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Burns: These can occur where the electrical current entered and exited the body, often on the skin.</li>
            <li>Muscle spasms: The current can cause involuntary muscle contractions, making it difficult to release the source of electricity.</li>
            <li>Numbness or tingling: Shock can affect the nervous system, causing numbness or a tingling sensation.</li>
            <li>Breathing difficulties: The electrical current can affect the respiratory muscles, leading to shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.</li>
            <li>Heart issues: An electric shock can disrupt heart rhythms, leading to chest pain, irregular heartbeats, or even cardiac arrest.</li>
            <li>Confusion and dizziness: The shock can disrupt brain function, leading to confusion, dizziness, or even loss of consciousness.</li>
            <li>Seizures: In severe cases, the electrical current can trigger seizures.</li>
        </ul>
        <P>Serious electric shock cases can result in immediate dangers like heart failure or respiratory arrest, and it's crucial to seek medical 
            help quickly. Even if the symptoms appear mild at first, complications such as internal injuries may develop later.
        </p>
        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <p>
            Electric shock occurs when a person comes into contact with an electrical current, which can cause damage to the body in various ways.
            The severity depends on factors such as the voltage, duration of contact, and the path the electricity takes through the body. Common causes of electric shock include:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Faulty electrical appliances: Using damaged or poorly maintained electrical devices can lead to shocks.</li>
            <li>Exposed wiring: Touching exposed or damaged wires can cause electric shock.</li>
            <li>Water and electricity: Water is a good conductor of electricity, so contact with electrical sources in wet conditions increases the risk.</li>
            <li>Lightning strikes: Being struck by lightning delivers a large electric charge, causing serious injury.</li>
            <li>Direct contact with power lines: Touching power lines or objects that are in contact with them can cause severe shock.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <P>
            Electric shocks can result in burns, nerve damage, and heart problems. Managing the environment by keeping electrical devices safe, 
            avoiding exposure to live wires, and staying away from water when handling electronics is essential to prevent electric shock.
